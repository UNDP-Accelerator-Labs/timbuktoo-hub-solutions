# About
This project computes a description of the entries in a dataset of grassroots innovations mapped on the African continent. The description consists of a 10-dimensional vector of scores from 0 to 4 and a text comment. The descriptions are then visualized as a radar diagram.

## Data
The data consists of the 6,297 grassroots innovations mapped by the [UNDP Accelerator Labs](https://acceleratorlabs.undp.org) and published in structured form in the [SDG Commons](https://sdg-innovation-commons.org) platform as of February 2025. Mapping is, by default, care of UNDP Accelerator Labs staff. However, the dataset includes about 2,300 solutions mapped by the UNDP Zambia Accelerator Lab through self-reporting via a third-party digital platform, and then imported onto the Commons. 

## Methods

The method we followed consists of a quantitative analysis meant to generate long lists of grassroots innovations classified according to (exogenous) thematic areas. Innovations in those lists were then examined qualitatively to detect patterns. By "pattern" we mean here either that multiple innovators were independently addressing the same need, or that multiple innovators (such as "clean cooking") were independently deploying the same technological strategy (such as "connect a machine to a solar panel for off-grid use").
