# About
This project computes a description of the entries in a dataset of grassroots innovations mapped on the African continent. The description consists of a 10-dimensional vector of scores from 0 to 4 and a text comment. The descriptions are then visualized as a radar diagram.

## Data
The data consists of the 6,297 grassroots innovations mapped by the [UNDP Accelerator Labs](https://acceleratorlabs.undp.org) and published in structured form in the [SDG Commons](https://sdg-innovation-commons.org) platform as of February 2025.
